This is the readme/install/faq document for LOTRO Companion.

Note:
English is not my mother-tongue, so I apologize if this document contains some weird/meaningless sentences! Let me know so that I can fix this document in future releases.

0. INSTALLATION
===============
Unzip the lotro-companion-N.P.zip to somewhere on your hard-drive.

1. RUNNING LOTRO COMPANION
==========================
You'll need a Java Runtime Environment for Java 6.
LOTRO Companion shall run on Windows and Linux.
Mac OS has not been tested but hopefully it will work since its pure Java code.

1.1 Windows
-----------
Run the "LotroCompanion.exe" file.
It will check if you have a suitable Java Runtime Environment and link you to the Oracle site to download/install one if needed.
This executable will check 32-bit JRE only, so if you have a 64-bit JRE, it will not be found.

1.2 Linux
---------
Set the executable flag on the LotroCompanion.sh file.
Run the companion.sh file to launch LOTRO Companion.

1.3 Internet connection
-----------------------
This new version of LOTRO Companion does not require an Internet connection.

2. UPGRADING FROM A PREVIOUS VERSION
====================================

2.1 FROM LOTRO COMPANION 1.0, 2.0 or 3.0
----------------------------------------
Install the new version in its own directory.
Copy or move all the files/directories in the data/characters of the old installation to the data/characters directory in the new installation.

Then run LOTRO Companion. You'll get back all the toons you had previously.

my.lotro.com has been discontinued so the old features such as 'character log', 'levelling', 'crafting history' and 'warbands'
won't be able to download the updated character data.

3. MISC/FAQ
===========
3.1 Known issues
----------------
The items database is not perfect.
The application cannot handle scalable items correctly. Instead, it will provide only a given level of each such item.
The application does not include all possible buff (even if we're talking only about passives).

4. LICENSE

See the LICENSE.TXT file in the doc directory of the distribution.
The licenses of the distributed libraries can be found in doc/licenses.
