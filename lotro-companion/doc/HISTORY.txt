LOTRO Companion
Release Notes / History

4.0beta1 (2017-02-01)
Rebirth of the application.
Old features based on character log won't work anymore (since my.lotro.com has been stopped).
Now the main goal of the application is simulation.
It will compute the stats of characters based on what gear/virtues/buffs you're using.
It has been tested to be quite accurate on several level 100-105 characters of different classes/races (not all of them).
