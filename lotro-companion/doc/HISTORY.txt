Rebirth of the application.
Old features based on character log won't work anymore (since my.lotro.com has been stopped).
Now the main goal of the application is simulation.
It will compute the stats of characters based on what gear/virtues/buffs you're using.
It has been tested to be quite accurate on several level 100-105 characters of different classes/races (not all of them).

Main features are:
	- warbands statistics (on several toons)
	- levelling graphics (on several toons)

	- 'about' window with version, contact e-mail and contributors
and many small bug fixes

Main features/bug fixes are:

	- homogeneous color theme
	- better automatic location of windows
	- added items count (filtered/total) in character log window
	- added a 'fix' button in the character log window to repair logs that contain 'completed a deed/quest' items
	- fixed a bug that prevented it from running under Linux
